Spring Boot with Microservices" refers to the use of the Spring Boot framework to develop and manage microservices-based architectures. Spring Boot simplifies the process of building microservices by providing an opinionated framework that minimizes configuration, offers production-ready features, and allows developers to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate code.
